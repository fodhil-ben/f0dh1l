<h2 id="my-journey-to-hackerone">My Journey to HackerOne</h2>
<p>After 2.5 years of playing CTFs, I decided to start doing bug bounty to test my skills and try to make some money. My first month on Bugcrowd was mixed - I got some N/A reports, a few informational findings, and some valid P4/P3 vulnerabilities.</p>
<p>Bugcrowd isn&rsquo;t a bad platform, but I had found some critical vulnerabilities there and submitted them. The problem was that they didn&rsquo;t respond to my reports for more than 2 weeks, which made me lose motivation to keep hunting on the same platform. So I decided to switch to HackerOne to get my motivation back.</p>]]></description>
